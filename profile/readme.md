# 🌟Welcome to Timberline Studio!🌟

For Beastro, we had our own homebrew [coding standard](https://github.com/Timberline-Studio/TimberlineStandard), but will swap to the [Unreal Coding Standard](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine?application_version=5.6) for future projects.
